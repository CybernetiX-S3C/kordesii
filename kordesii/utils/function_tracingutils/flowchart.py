Module: flowchart.py

Created: 3 May 18

Description:
    This module uses the idaapi.FlowChart object and extends it as well as idaapi.BasicBlock in order to add 
    functionality including Breadth-First and Depth-First chart traversal, locating a specific block within the
    chart based on an EA, generating a list of all possible paths to a specified EA, etc.
